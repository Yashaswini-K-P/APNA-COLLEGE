Qs. Find the errors in the following code?
    a. let 1age=5;
       let 2age=10;
    Ans. You cannot start a variable name with digits instead 
         let age1 = 5;
         let age2 = 10;

    b. let marks = 75;
       let isPass = True;
    Ans. There is no word called True, you might have trying to initialise
         boolean true to isPass for that 
         let isPass = true;
    c. let isPass = 'true';
    Ans. There is no error in this code, The isPass variable stores string
         if you are trying to intitialise boolean then this is wrong instead
         let isPass = true;
